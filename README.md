# DQN-for-Cartpole-v1-Gym-Environment
DQN algorithm implemented through the pytorch tutorial. 

More information:
DQN algorithm implemented through the pytorch tutorial. It's implementation contemples an approach that inputs continuous state variables to the NN inputs, i want to discover if that state input variables discretized instead of continuous can still solve the CartPole environment. I hope discretized state variable, the time to learn decreases.
